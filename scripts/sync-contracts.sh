# Vendors the pinned pocket-nutrition-contracts artefacts into contract/.
#
# WHY VENDOR RATHER THAN SUBMODULE
# A stale submodule pointer is silent: the build succeeds, the app compiles, and it is quietly using
# last month's schema. Vendored files put the contract in the diff, so a change is reviewed like any
# other change — and --verify turns going stale into a build failure instead of a surprise.
#
#   ./scripts/sync-contracts.sh --update    # refresh contract/ from the pinned version
#   ./scripts/sync-contracts.sh --verify    # CI: fail if contract/ differs from the pinned version
#
# The pin is CONTRACTS_VERSION. Source defaults to the sibling clone; override with PN_CONTRACTS_DIR.
#
# contract/swift is a real SwiftPM target (see Package.swift), so the vendored Tokens.swift compiles
# where it lands rather than being copied a second time into Sources/. That keeps contract/ a single
# tree this script fully owns, which is what makes a byte-for-byte --verify possible.

Vendored from pocket-nutrition-contracts ${PINNED}
by scripts/sync-contracts.sh — do not edit these files by hand.

They are generated or curated upstream. To change one: change it in the contracts
repository, tag a release, bump CONTRACTS_VERSION here, and run --update.
