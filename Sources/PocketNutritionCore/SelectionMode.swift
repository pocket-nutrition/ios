/// Multi-term search is what makes this question exist. `GET /ingredients/search` reports how many
/// ingredient phrases it split the query into, in the `X-Segment-Count` response header; when that is
/// more than one, the person is composing a meal rather than picking a single food, and a tap should
/// accumulate a selection they confirm in one go.
///
/// **The term count must come from that header, never from counting spaces.** The server segments with
/// greedy longest-match probes against the search index, so `pomme de terre` is *one* term while
/// `riz poulet pomme` is three. A client splitting on whitespace would offer checkboxes for a single
/// potato — which is exactly why the count is a server concern and the header exists at all.
///
/// **Recipes are the exception, and it is the reason this is pinned rather than written inline twice.**
/// A recipe is not one of the query's terms: it unpacks into a whole meal by itself, through
/// `unpackRecipe`. Miss that branch and recipes become silently un-addable the moment a query has two
/// words — no compiler complains, no other test notices, and the highest-value row in the list stops
/// working.
